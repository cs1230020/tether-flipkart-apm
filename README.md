## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a production-grade **Machine Learning System** designed to detect fraudulent insurance claims. Unlike traditional monolithic models, this system employs a **Clustering-Based Ensemble Architecture** to handle the high heterogeneity of insurance data.

It is designed to solve real-world engineering problems such as **Class Imbalance** (99% non-fraud vs 1% fraud), **Data Leakage**, and **Schema Skew** in production environments.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Divide & Conquer Strategy:** Uses **K-Means Clustering** to segment claims into behavioral groups before classification.
* **Dynamic Model Selection:** Automatically runs a tournament between **XGBoost** and **SVM** for *each* cluster and selects the winner based on AUC scores.
* **Production Safety:** Includes a custom **Schema Alignment** layer to handle missing columns in prediction data without crashing.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Utilizes `RandomOverSampler` to synthetically balance the dataset, ensuring the model doesn't just bias towards the majority class.
* **Deployment:** Exposed via a **Flask API** for real-time inference.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The pipeline follows a strict lifecycle:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Validation:**
    * Validates file names using Regex.
    * Rejects files with missing columns or incorrect types.
2.  **Preprocessing Layer:**
    * **Imputation:** Custom logic (`preprocessing.py`) to handle missing values based on data types.
    * **Scaling:** Saves `StandardScaler` statistics during training to prevent **Data Leakage** during prediction.
3.  **Clustering Layer:**
    * Uses **K-Means** with the **Elbow Method** (programmatic detection using `KneeLocator`) to find the optimal number of clusters.
4.  **Model Training (The Ensemble):**
    * For every cluster $i$, the system trains both an **XGBoost** and an **SVM** model.
    * It compares them using `ROC-AUC` and `F1-Score`.
    * The best model is saved as `Model_Cluster_i.sav`.
5.  **Prediction Layer:**
    * New data is cleaned, scaled, and assigned a cluster.
    * It is then routed to the specific model trained for that cluster.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### 1. Start the Server
Run the Flask application:

    python main.py

*You will see a message: `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`*

### 2. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Training the Model
To train the model from scratch using the raw data:

1.  Look for the **"Train New Models"** section.
2.  In the text box, paste the **Absolute Path** to your training batch folder.  
    *Example:* `/Users/jyotichoudhary/Desktop/InsuranceFraudDetectionUsingMachineLearning/Training_Batch_Files`
3.  Click the yellow **Train Model** button.
4.  Wait for the process to complete. You will see `Training Status: Training successful!!` in the **Results** box on the right.

### 4. Prediction
To generate predictions on new data:

1.  Click the blue **Default File Predict** button.
2.  The system will process the test files and generate a prediction.
3.  Look for the message `Prediction File created Successfully !!!` in the **Results** box.

### 5. Viewing the Output
Once prediction is complete, the results are saved to a CSV file.

1.  Navigate to the folder `Prediction_Output_File`.
2.  Open `Predictions.csv`.
3.  You will see the `Predictions` column:
    * **Y** = Yes (Fraud Detected) 🚨
    * **N** = No (Legitimate Claim) ✅

## 📊 Performance Results

The system was evaluated on a highly imbalanced insurance dataset. The **Clustering + Ensemble** approach significantly outperformed the baseline SVM model.

| Metric | XGBoost (Selected) | SVM (Baseline) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **99.8% - 100%** | ~40% - 65% |
| **Precision** | **High (>0.95)** | Low / Inconsistent |
| **Recall (Fraud)** | **1.0 (100%)** | Variable |
| **AUC Score** | **1.0** | 0.5 - 0.6 |

**Why XGBoost Won?**
The analysis proved that fraud patterns are **highly non-linear**. SVM (a linear separator) struggled to separate the classes effectively, often yielding low precision or failing to converge on a decision boundary. XGBoost's ensemble decision trees successfully identified fraud cases with near-perfect precision after oversampling.

## 🔧 Engineering Highlights (Interview Defense)

* **Thread-Safety Patch:** Implemented a runtime patch in `file_methods.py` to fix a `_n_threads` attribute error caused by Scikit-Learn version mismatch during migration.
* **Schema Alignment:** The `predictFromModel.py` includes a dynamic check that injects missing columns (with 0s) into prediction data if they don't match the training schema, preventing "Dimension Mismatch" errors in production.
